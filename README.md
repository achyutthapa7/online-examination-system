# Online Examination System

## Description

This project is an **Online Examination System** designed to streamline exam management, student registration, and subject assignments for educational institutions. The system is divided into three primary roles—**Admin**, **Teacher**, and **Student**—each with specific functionalities.

- **Admin** has full control over the system. Admins can:

  - Manage users (students and teachers).
  - Verify student registrations.
  - Assign teachers to subjects.
  - Approve or start exams created by teachers.
  - View a list of exams, update user passwords, send notifications, and delete users (teachers or students) as needed.

- **Teachers** are responsible for:

  - Creating and managing exams for the subjects they are assigned to.
  - Viewing student submissions and results for the exams they’ve created.

- **Students** can:
  - Register once, and upon admin approval, access the system to view and enroll in available courses.
  - View upcoming exams (created by teachers but not yet started by the admin) and available exams (approved and started by the admin).
  - Take exams only if they have not already submitted them, and if the exam matches their current year and semester.

This system ensures a seamless workflow for creating, approving, and taking exams, while providing flexibility for each role to manage their responsibilities efficiently.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/achyutthapa7/online-examination-system.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd online-examination-system
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
cd admin && npm install && cd ../backend && npm install && cd ../user && npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add the necessary environment variables. Here is an example of the `.env` file:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/BCA_Online_Examination_System
SECRET_KEY=JWTSecretKey
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASS=admin
# USERNAME=yourgoogleaccount@gmail.com
# PASS=Authorization token from Google here
```

#### Environment Variables:

- `MONGO_URI`: The URI for your MongoDB database.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for JWT token signing.
- `ADMIN_USER`: The admin username for the application.
- `ADMIN_PASS`: The admin password for the application.
- `USERNAME`: Your email address (usually a Gmail account) for sending emails.
- `PASS`: The **authorization token** generated by Google (OAuth 2.0 token or App Password).

> **Note**: The app will function without issues, except for the email functionality, unless the correct `USERNAME` and `PASS` (Google authorization token) are provided. These fields are currently commented out in the `.env` file. Please uncomment and replace them with your actual `USERNAME` and `PASS` (OAuth token or App Password) once you have them.

### 5. Start the Development Server

After setting up the environment variables, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend && node server.js
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:4000` (or the configured port).

---

### 6. Start the Application

After starting the server, follow these instructions to run the application:

```bash
# Start the user side application
cd user && npm run dev

# Start the admin side application
cd admin && npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:5174` (or the configured port).

---

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1. Log in as the administrator with the credentials from the `.env` file (`ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASS`).
2. Manage online exams, students, and teachers through the web interface.
3. Students can log in and take exams that have been created by the teacher.

### Additional Tips:

- **Database Setup**: Ensure that MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas. Update the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file accordingly.
- **Sending Emails**: If you need email functionality, make sure you've set up your Gmail account correctly, especially if you need to use **OAuth2** or **App Passwords** for authentication.
